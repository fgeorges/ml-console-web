# Introduction

The ML Console provides the MarkLogic developer with some tools to assist them
in their daily tasks.

It is used as well to help beginners to get on board with the MarkLogic
platform, as it provides a clear UI, rather than requiring to write code in
QConsole from day one.  Which, to be honest, is a bit intimidating.

It provides 5 main areas:

- [Browser](../browser/)
- [Jobs and tasks](../jobs/)
- [Project manager](../projects/)
- [Documents helper](../documents/)
- [Profiler](../profiler/)
